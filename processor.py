class Processor:
    """A class represents a single Processor in the membership system

    A Processor represents the abstract concept of Processor or Server in Cristianâ€™s
    "Reaching Agreement on Processor Group Membership in Synchronous Distributed Systems" paper.
    A Processor can send a direct message to other processor or broadcast to all correct processors. It also keeps track
    of its status, its view of the membership of group T. It may also contain clock synchronization error when
    initialized.

    Attributes:
        _id: A int indicating the id of this Processor
        _current_group: A int indicating the current group the processor belongs to
        _status: A int constant indicating the status of the Processor
        _membership: A list contains the Processor's view of its memberships in the _current_group
        _channel: A Channel object where the processor is attached to
        _clock_diff: A float representing the clock synchronization error of this Processor clock from the master clock
